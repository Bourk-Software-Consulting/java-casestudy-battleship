# java-casestudy-battleship
this is an application to play the game Battleship. The code is poorly designed and buggy, on purpose. 
It is for students to practices Clean Code, Design Patterns, and the SOLID principles.

Backlog
- allow the positioning of the Ships by entering coordinate of the bow and horientation.
  example: A2H will place a ship of size 3 on A2,A3,A4
- allow a static display of the two grids, displaying your ship placements with the shots the other player made, 
  and another grid with your shots results
- allow a different display of an explosion per ship
- add a proper GUI
